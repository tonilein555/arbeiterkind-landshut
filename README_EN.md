# 🎓 Arbeiterkind Landshut - Anonymous Question Tool

A lightweight, anonymous Q&A tool for students and prospective students from non-academic backgrounds.  
Originally developed for the local group of [Arbeiterkind.de](https://arbeiterkind.de) in Landshut, Germany - to make access to educational advice easier and more private.

## ✨ Features

- Submit questions anonymously, without registration
- Choose a category for your question
- Public (but anonymous) answers shown on the homepage
- Supabase used as backend (auth + database)
- Fully mobile-friendly, minimal and fast
- Built independently and voluntarily

## 🧠 Why this project?

First-generation students often hesitate to ask questions about higher education - out of fear, uncertainty, or lack of a support network.  
This tool lowers the barrier by allowing anonymous, asynchronous questions and making answers visible to everyone who might benefit from them.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) - backend, auth, database
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - deployment and hosting
